You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
 

I have learned some new tags like: <meta charset="UTF-8">, <sub>, <sup>, <strike>; 
* What has been easy?
 
It has been easy to realise the tasks because I already had a little background in HTML 
* What has been difficult?

  The way that you explained the concept of paths was a little foggy. But I understood it in the end (maybe because I've used paths before).
* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
